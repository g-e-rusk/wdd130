    <h2>Geri Rusk</h2>
    <p>    Hi!  My name is Geri and I am from California (born and mostly raised here). I am pursuing my BS in Applied Technology.
        I dabbled in html in the early 2000s when I worked for a commerical computer repair company.  In late 2003 I became
        a stay-at-home mom when my second child was born.  I went back to school and in 2007, I received my BA in English
        with the intention to get my teaching credentials. Four children later, 
        and homeschooling all of them have taught me that I did not want to get into teaching. I have always been interested
        in Web Design; I am leaning towards that aspect of the Applied Technology field.</p>
    <p>    I am happily married to my best friend and we just celebrated 25 years this past June.  With 1 kid already
        out of the house, and two more leaving this next year, I am working on increasing my skills and becoming more
        marketable in the job field. When I am not studying, or homeschooling, I like to read, watch TV, listen to music, exercise, and I am trying to return to digital scrapbooking. Last year I went to my first concert ever, and since 
        then I have been to 4 total, with 3 more planned concerts.  I love to laugh and tell jokes. I have been a member of the church my entire life.  While in my senior year of high school, I came across one of 
        my favorite scriptures at Seminary. It is Mosiah 4:27 - "And see that all these things are done in wisdom and order;
        for it is not requisite that a man should run faster than he has strength."  It was one of the first times that the scriptures
        really spoke to me. I have had more experiences in the scriptures since then. I am looking forward to learning as much as I can.</p>
